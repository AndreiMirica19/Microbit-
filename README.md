# Microbit-
The purpose of this theme is to implement a utility capable of executing Linux bash commands.

To solve the assigment I will create a Python script that reads from the keyboard commands that it executes. Once run, the executable will display a prompt in the form cmd: it will receive a command followed by the parameters. Pressing the ENTER key marks the end of the command. After each order, the program will display the result, if any, and then wait for another order. The program will end its execution by receiving the exit or quit command.
